# Cached Initial States

In this directory we include cached initial states. These mean that we can
initialize all the different environments used for training and validation,
without having to re-generate them. By "initialize" we refer to creating and
setting positions of shapes and particles.

For reproducing the CoRL 2022 paper results, use: `PourWater_nVars_1500_v01.pkl`
and `PourWater6D_nVars_2000_v01.pkl`, which correspond to PourWater 3D and
PourWater 6D, respectively.
